Docker image for Sylvain Schmitt's SSDM R package. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SSDM/index.html

By default, running a SSDM container starts a R session with the SSDM package and its dependencies available.

SSDM: Stacked Species Distribution Modelling

Allows to map species richness and endemism based on stacked species distribution models (SSDM). Individuals SDMs can be created using a single or multiple algorithms (ensemble SDMs). For each species, an SDM can yield a habitat suitability map, a binary map, a between-algorithm variance map, and can assess variable importance, algorithm accuracy, and between- algorithm correlation. Methods to stack individual SDMs include summing individual probabilities and thresholding then summing. Thresholding can be based on a specific evaluation metric or by drawing repeatedly from a Bernoulli distribution. The SSDM package also provides a user-friendly interface.
